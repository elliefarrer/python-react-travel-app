        <h2>About the Build</h2>

        <p>Vacilando was my first go at building a "proper" project in Python (Python 3.7, that is), my first ever go at doing anything with Django, and a welcome revisit to ReactJS. My React front end is built with Webpack, and the site is styled with SCSS and Bootstrap. I manage all my JS files with Homebrew.</p>
